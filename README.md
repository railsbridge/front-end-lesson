Front-end Project Starter Kit
==

This contains all of the files needed to display the three major portions of front-end
engineering

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

The `/resource` directory contains the styles and javascript along with an example image to be used during the lesson.

You'll notice that this project has already been finished.  That is to say, styles have been added to the resources directory
and except for the HTML page not including those css files, the styling has been finished.

If you are grabbing these files as a starter kit for an HTML/CSS cource, we recommend using a the version available [here](https://github.com/eanakashima/front-end-lesson/).
